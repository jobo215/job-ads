Internet platform for advertising and applying for job vacancies, which will enable users to directly exchange information on supply and demand, without intermediaries and without the possibility of data manipulation.

Within the system, it is necessary to have four types of users:

1) Unregistered user - can view ads, can see the list of employers, but cannot log in.
2) Registered user (role Employer) - can place job ads. The Employer and the job position are linked to each advertisement.
3) Registered user (role Worker) - can do anything that an unregistered user can, in addition, apply for a job.
4) Application administrator - will have all the rights as a registered user with the addition of user administration, ie. deleting users from the system and the possibility of deleting ads belonging to the Employer.

An application should have:

1) Employer and Worker (Profile: picture, name, surname…)
2) Ad (Employer, job position)
3) Job categories, subcategories - (programmer — Java)
4) Search (structured and / or free)
5) Employee registration for an ad
6) Employer evaluation
7) Ad liking
8) Categorizing business offers with remote or not
9) Possibility to change your personal data forwarded during registration
10) Statistics of an Employer (How many ad views, How many applications…)
